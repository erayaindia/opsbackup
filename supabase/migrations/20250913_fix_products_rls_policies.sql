-- Fix RLS Policies for Products Table
-- This migration ensures authenticated users can perform all operations on products table

-- Drop existing policies that might be restrictive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view products they have access to" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_select_products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_insert_products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_update_products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_delete_products" ON products;

-- Create comprehensive policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all products"
ON products FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert products"
ON products FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update products"
ON products FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete products"
ON products FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Ensure RLS is enabled on products table
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Also ensure our new lifecycle tables have proper policies
-- (These should already exist from the main migration, but let's be sure)

-- Product Ideas table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can access product_ideas" ON product_ideas;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access product_ideas"
ON product_ideas FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Product Categories table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can access product_categories" ON product_categories;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access product_categories"
ON product_categories FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Product Tags table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can access product_tags" ON product_tags;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access product_tags"
ON product_tags FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Product Reference Links table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can access product_reference_links" ON product_reference_links;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access product_reference_links"
ON product_reference_links FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Product Activities table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can access product_activities" ON product_activities;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access product_activities"
ON product_activities FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify policies are working with a test query
