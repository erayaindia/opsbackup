# Shot Delete Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Type Mismatch in ID Handling**
**Problem**: The `ShotListItemProps` interface expected `id: number` but shots were using string IDs like `"new_${Date.now()}"`.

**Fix**: Updated interface to accept `id: string | number`
```typescript
// Before
id: number;

// After  
id: string | number;
```

### 2. **Inconsistent ID Generation**
**Problem**: Database shots used `Date.now() + Math.random()` (number) while new shots used `"new_${Date.now()}"` (string).

**Fix**: Made all IDs strings for consistency
```typescript
// Before
id: shot.id || Date.now() + Math.random(),

// After
id: shot.id || `db_${Date.now()}_${Math.random()}`,
```

### 3. **Database Delete Logic for New Shots**
**Problem**: New shots (with `new_` prefix) were trying to delete from database before being saved.

**Fix**: Added check to skip database delete for new shots
```typescript
if (typeof id === 'string' && id.startsWith('new_')) {
  console.log('Skipping database delete for new shot');
} else {
  await ContentService.deleteShotById(id);
}
```

## 🛠 Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`shot-list-item.tsx`**
   - ✅ Fixed ID type: `id: string | number`
   - ✅ Fixed function signatures: `onUpdate/onDelete` now accept `string | number`
   - ✅ Added delete button debugging logs

2. **`ContentDetail.tsx`**
   - ✅ Fixed ID generation consistency (all strings)
   - ✅ Enhanced delete handler with comprehensive debugging
   - ✅ Added logic to handle new shots vs database shots differently

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Test Steps:
1. **Open the app and navigate to a content item**
2. **Add some test shots** (these will have `new_` prefix IDs)
3. **Save the content** (converts `new_` IDs to database IDs)
4. **Add more shots** (mix of saved and new shots)
5. **Try deleting different shots** and check console logs

### Expected Console Output:
When you click delete, you should see:
```
🗑️ Delete button clicked for shot: {id: "new_1234567890", description: "...", order: 0}
🎬 DELETE HANDLER - Shot ID to delete: new_1234567890
🎬 DELETE HANDLER - Current shotList: [{id: "...", description: "...", order: 0}, ...]
🎬 DELETE HANDLER - Found shot to delete: {id: "new_1234567890", ...}
🎬 DELETE HANDLER - Skipping database delete for new shot
🎬 DELETE HANDLER - New shotList after filter: [remaining shots...]
✅ Shot deleted successfully
```

## 🎯 Key Debugging Info

The enhanced logging will show you:
1. **Which shot was clicked for deletion**
2. **All shots currently in the list**  
3. **Whether the shot was found in the list**
4. **Whether database delete was attempted**
5. **The final list after deletion**

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

If the wrong shot is still being deleted, check the console logs to see:

1. **ID Matching**: Does the clicked shot ID match what the delete handler receives?
2. **Shot Order**: Are the shots being rendered in the correct order?
3. **React Keys**: Is the `key={shot.id}` prop on ShotListItem causing React to reuse components incorrectly?

### Quick Debug Commands:
Run these in browser console:
```javascript
// Check current shots
console.log('Current shots:', window.editable?.shotList)

// Check for ID conflicts
const shots = window.editable?.shotList || [];
const ids = shots.map(s => s.id);
const duplicates = ids.filter((id, index) => ids.indexOf(id) !== index);
console.log('Duplicate IDs:', duplicates);
```
